# PasswordEncryptor
Takes in passwords and encrypts them that way people don't just have your passwords if they get leaked.
It is fairly simply as of right now so it only takes in passwords with numbers and strings no special characters
it can do both uppercase and lowercase however.

It should also be noted that to use this you can just download this file onto your computer and then run it using
any C# ide. From there you can just put in any password in the PasswordEncryption constructor call and it will
print to the console the encrypted version.

Lastly again do NOT put in special characters it will not work. You are free to make a version that can do that,
but this version does not.
